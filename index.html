        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>So...Where to start... <br /> 
            My name is Alice. I'm 25 years old. I'm French and Colombian. <br /> 
            I've always been passionate by web developpment and just started 6 months ago. I love it. <br />
            With this web page, I'm going to present you a little of what I like in life, what I do most of my days and the places where I have lived (with pictures included). <br /> 
            <br /> You will be able to get my Spotify and Instagram link to see more if you are ever interested :)
